## Hello Everybody!

This is a PHP boilerplate for the WordPress REST API.
It is based on [Foundation for Sites](foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/).

##### First time install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nodopiano/wp-api-php-boilerplate
yarn
bower install
composer install
```

##### To run the project 
(it starts a php server, so you need PHP > 5.6)
```
yarn start
```

- Routing, bootstrapping and autoloading are heavily inspired by Jeffrey Way's Laracast lessons: "[The PHP Practitioner](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners/)". 
We are better developers because of him. 

- The idea of a slim and fast boilerplate for WP API came from a talk at Milan WordCamp 2016 by [Siobhan McKeown](https://2016.milano.wordcamp.org/session/the-wordpress-rest-api-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/)
